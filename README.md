# Pennydrop

Penny Drop is a tabletop game for two or more players where the players take turns rolling a single D6 (normal six-sided dice are called D6s). The rules are as follows:

1. The player rolls a number and then puts a penny (a small coin) into the slot number they just moved.
2. If the slot is a 6, the penny falls through the board and is out of the game.
3. If the slot is already filled, the player takes all the pennies on the board and play passes them on to the next player.
4. Players must roll at least once, but can then pass their turn to the next person.
5. The first player to get rid of all their pennies is the winner.
